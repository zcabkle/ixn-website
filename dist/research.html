                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Python vs. Java</h2>
                        <p> First of all we decided on the language that we would use to implement this webapp. We
                            narrowed the choice down to the 2 most suitable languages. After analysis of their
                            advantages and disadvantages, we decided to choose Python. <br><br> The most notable
                            advantages of
                            Python over Java are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ All of the team are more comfortable coding in python, this is an advantage considering
                            the time constraints for the project. The same functionality can be written in less lines in
                            python compared to java.
                            This will make collaboration and implementation smoother.<br><br>

                            ☑ Moorfields mentioned that, in the future, they would like to be able to do statistical
                            analysis on the
                            data. Python is widely used among the data science community. After considering this, it
                            seemed that in the long term python was a better choice.<br><br>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Django vs. Flask</h2>
                        <p> After deciding on a language, we began by researching web frameworks best suited for
                            our use case.
                            We narrowed it down to two of the most popular Python frameworks, Django [1] and Flask [2].
                            <br>

                            After analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, we decided to choose Django as our web
                            development framework. Overall, the main reasons for doing so are because Django is more of
                            a heavy-weight framework, there are more features included in the framework that are
                            directly relevant to us. Think of Flask as a hammer and Django as a toolbox which happens
                            to give us everything that we need<br><br>
                            The most notable advantages of Django over Flask are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ Django comes with user authentication and access levels[], which is something we would
                            like,
                            particularly for seperating the ocularists and admin staff at Moorfields.
                            Flask does not come with this functionality.<br><br>

                            ☑ Django comes with an admin framework[], this is important for the longevity of the
                            project.
                            Users and groups can easily be edited from the admin page. This makes it easy to do things
                            like editing passwords.<br><br>

                            ☑ Django has a built-in ORM system[] which means two things. Firstly, we don't have to write
                            long SQL queries as database tables get directly mapped to python classes
                            instead we can 'query' the database with readable python code. Secondly, we have freedom to
                            choose which database to use, this gives us and future developers extra flexibility.<br><br>

                            ☑ For us Django is more secure, it is an open-source project that comes with security
                            features [] that protect against XSS, CSRF SQL injection and clickjacking [] to name a few.
                            Flask does not
                            come with this functionality. If we were to use Flask there are 2 main problems. Firstly, we
                            would have to create our own
                            security features. We are not security professionals so there is a very high chance
                            that they would be insecure and vulnerable to attack. Secondly, if we were to develop a
                            secure security system, it would take too long and we would have no time for the webapp.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Bootstrap vs. React
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We had to decide what tool we would use to style the webapp. We
                            narrowed the choice down to two if the most popular tools used for frontend design,
                            Bootstrap
                            and React which are both used to style web pages. After analysis of their
                            pros and cons, we decided to choose Bootstrap. <br><br> The most important
                            advantages of
                            Bootstrap over React are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap has more flexibility regarding screen sizes. Bootstrap utilises a grid system
                            meaning that anything you create with Bootstrap will be compatible across different device
                            types with different screen sizes.
                            This is an advantage for us because at the start of the project Moorfields expressed a
                            desire to eventually use the web app on a tablet or smartphone. Using Bootstrap means that
                            it will be easier to implement this functionality in the future.<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap works through CSS style sheets in contrast with React which uses JavaScript. All
                            of the team is familiar with CSS and HTML and not so confident in JavaScript. This is an
                            advantage considering
                            the time constraints for the project. All of the team know HTML and CSS syntax so using
                            Bootstrap will make collaboration and implementation smoother.<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap provides components that can be incredibly useful us and for future developers.
                            Components such as
                            carousels, accordians, buttons and custom search bars can help give the ocularist power
                            regarding the information they are accesesing. <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Deployment Tools</h2>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a software platform allowing
                            you to package your
                            application
                            in a isolated predictable enviroment called container. <br>
                            The container contains configurations and everything needed to run the
                            application so that you
                            can run application in different host easily.<br>
                            Docker might looks like a virtual machine but here are some key differences
                            and advangtages:<br>
                            1.Docker is free! Cost efficient haha<br>
                            2.Docker is light weight and fast to boost.It takes deployment time to
                            seconds whereas A VM can
                            take a few minutes to be dev-ready.<br>
                            3.Docker targets at Operating systems which makes docker images free of
                            enviromental limitations
                            and can be run everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p> Linode and Azure provides cloud hosting services.
                            Both Linode and Azure has good performance but Linode is more economically
                            efficient.
                            Azure has better security than linode. Azure's security system has multiple
                            layers,
                            including key features such as Web Application vulnerability scanning,
                            automated encryption in
                            transit,encryption at rest and most importantly network security[4]
                            As our application deals with sensitive patient data ,privacy is important.
                            Therefore we choose Azure to host our application.
