                        <p>
                            While formulating the requirements for our proof-of-concept we looked at some time
                            scheduling applications such as Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar. We did this to see
                            what is feasible
                            and to give us a greater idea of what our application could look like. Having a greater idea
                            of what is feasible would help us to avoid agreeing on over-optimistic requirements with our
                            client.
                            We found that time scheduling apps broadly solve the same problem that we were trying to
                            solve for Moorfields. Our problem, in essence, is to provide a way to block time out and
                            then show this to
                            the user on the interface.<br><br>

                            We looked at features that Outlook Calendar and Google Calendar provide that could be
                            beneficial to Moorfields in the proof-of-concept that we were developing.
                            Most features were too complex to completely implement in the given timeframe. In these
                            cases we didn't
                            consider implementing it or we aimed to implement a variation of it.<br><br>

                            Below are some examples of features in Outlook Calendar and Google Calendar that we took
                            inspiration from.<br>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Python vs. Java</h2>
                        <p> First of all we decided on the language that we would use to implement this webapp. We
                            narrowed the choice down to two of the most suitable languages based on implementing
                            webapps [1], [2]. We all have experience in both languages. After analysis of their
                            advantages and disadvantages, we decided to choose Python. <br><br> The most notable
                            advantages of
                            Python over Java are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ All of the team are more comfortable coding in Python, this is an advantage considering
                            the time constraints for the project.<br><br>

                            ☑ Python programs are usually 3x-5x shorter than their Java counterparts [3].<br><br>

                            ☑ Also Java tends towards 'wordiness' while Python tends towards 'expressiveness' [4] as
                            shown in the diagram [4] below.<br><br>
                            <img class="card-img-top " src="assets/img/wordiness.png" alt="Card image cap"><br>

                            The three factors above will make debugging, collaboration and implementation smoother in
                            Python
                            compared
                            to Java.<br><br>

                            ☑ Moorfields mentioned that in the future, they would like to be able to do statistical
                            analysis on the
                            data. Python is widely used among the data science community [5]. After considering this, it
                            seemed that in the long term Python was a better choice.<br><br>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Django vs. Flask</h2>
                        <p> After deciding on a language, we started researching web frameworks best suited for
                            our use case.
                            We narrowed it down to two of the most popular Python frameworks [6], Django and Flask.
                            <br><br>

                            After analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, we decided to choose Django as our web
                            development framework. Overall, the main reasons for doing so are because Django is more of
                            a heavy-weight framework, there are more features included in the framework that are
                            directly relevant to us. Think of Flask as a hammer and Django as a toolbox which happens
                            to give us everything that we need to develop our proof of concept.<br><br>
                            The most notable advantages of Django over Flask are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ Django comes with user authentication [7] and permissions [7], which is something we would
                            like,
                            particularly for seperating the ocularists and admin staff at Moorfields.
                            Flask does not come with this functionality.<br><br>

                            ☑ Django comes with an admin framework [8], this is important for the longevity of the
                            project.
                            Users and groups can easily be edited from the admin page. This makes future admin tasks
                            such as editing passwords very easy to do and neither us, nor future developers, will need
                            to spend time developing this functionality.<br><br>

                            ☑ Django has a built-in Object-Relational Mapper [9] which means two things. Firstly, we
                            don't have to write
                            long SQL queries as database tables get directly mapped to Python classes
                            instead we can 'query' the database with readable python code [10]. Secondly, we have
                            freedom
                            to
                            choose which database to use [11], this gives us and future developers extra
                            flexibility.<br><br>

                            ☑ For us Django is more secure, it is an open-source project that comes with security
                            features that protect against XSS, CSRF SQL injection and clickjacking [12] and an
                            authentication system.
                            Flask by itself does not
                            come with this functionality, a downside of this is extra dependencies are needed to
                            implement a secure system.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Bootstrap vs. React
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We had to decide what tool we would use to style the webapp. We
                            narrowed the choice down to two popular tools used for frontend design,
                            Bootstrap
                            and React which are both used to style web pages. After analysis of their
                            pros and cons, we decided to choose Bootstrap. <br><br> The most important
                            advantages of
                            Bootstrap over React are as follows:<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap has more flexibility regarding screen sizes. Bootstrap utilises a grid system
                            meaning that anything you create with Bootstrap will be compatible across different device
                            types with different screen sizes [13].
                            This is an advantage for us because at the start of the project Moorfields expressed a
                            desire to eventually use the web app on a tablet or smartphone. Using Bootstrap means that
                            it will be easier to implement this functionality in the future.<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap works through CSS style sheets [14] in contrast with React which uses
                            JavaScript [15].
                            All
                            of the team is familiar with CSS and HTML and not so confident in JavaScript. This is an
                            advantage considering
                            the time constraints for the project. All of the team know HTML and CSS syntax so using
                            Bootstrap will make collaboration and implementation smoother.<br><br>

                            ☑ Bootstrap provides components which can be incredibly useful us and for future developers.
                            Components such as
                            carousels, accordians, buttons and custom search bars [16] can help give the ocularist power
                            regarding the information they are accesesing. <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-title text-gradient">Deployment Tools</h2>
                        <p> For deployment we decided to use a Docker container and host it on Azure.<br><br>

                            Docker containers and virtual machines have similar uses though we decided to use Docker as
                            it is more suited to our use case.<br><br>

                            Docker allows us to package the application
                            in an isolated predictable enviroment called a container [17], a virtual machine on the
                            other
                            hand boots up a whole guest operating system to run the application on [18]. This is more
                            resource heavy [18]. The more lightweight option of Docker containers is more suitable for
                            us
                            developing at this stage as we are only developing one application. In further iterations of
                            this project it may be nessecary to
                            switch to hosting on a virtual machine. An example would be if multiple systems were to be
                            integrated such as synchronising our workflow management app with PAS, this would be a
                            relatively large
                            project with multiple applications involved so a virtual machine may be more suitable in
                            this
                            use case. <br><br>


                            For options of cloud services, our main choices were Azure and AWS. They both have
                            integration with Docker [19]. However, Docker specifically states that
                            Azure offers 'tight integration between Docker Desktop and Microsoft Azure' [19]. This fact
                            is
                            useful
                            to us and to future developers. Both offer a near identical service to eachother. If real
                            data were to be used on the application we would have thoroughly looked at the security
                            implications of using
                            these services.
                            This meant that the main consideration for us was the price and it was cheaper to go with
                            Azure since UCL
                            provided us with credits. Docker provides great support for AWS and other cloud services
                            [19]
                            so future developers will
                            have an easy time switching service if they deem nessecary.
