                    <p>
                        We keep track of issues in our google docs.
                        We had a problem with setting date format for the date time picker but we manages to solved it
                        after reading documentations and posting on stackoverfow.<br>
                        We still have improvements left on our list but the bug list is now empty!

                    <br>
                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">User Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        We followed HCI design priciples of visibility, consistency and feedback while implementing our
                        user
                        interfaces.<br> There are various examples of where we applied these principles across our
                        system, these examples can be found by clicking the 'UI Design' tab on the nagivation
                        bar.<br><br>

                        Also, we always made attempts to evaluate the project from a user's perspective, this was done
                        in 2 ways.<br><br>

                        ☑ We demonstrated our progress with the project in our weekly meetings to Moorfields. As our
                        client was going to be the main user of the system, their feedback was from a user's
                        perspective. We considered their feedback to help build a system that provided the best user
                        experience.
                        We balanced their feedback with the time constrsaints to avoid scope creep.<br><br>

                        ☑ We conducted a user acceptance test's on users who have not used the system before. We used
                        users
                        who have different level of software proficiency to perform tasks on our system.
                        The result shows that all testers found our application easy to use.
                        A senior ocularists at Moorfields said they were particularly impressed by the design of the
                        rota page. Testers pointed out that found difficulty in selecting and viewing multiple
                        ocularists'
                        rotas on the team rota page. To remedy this, we created a user manual which, gives new users
                        instructions on how to use our system. Further feedback from our user acceptance tests can be
                        found on the 'Testing' tab on
                        the navigation bar.<br><br>

                        Overall, from the feedback from our client (who is also the user), and our user acceptance
                        testers, our application provides a simple, easy to use and usable user interface. We believe that this was
                        achieved by stringently following the HCI design principles.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Functionality</h3>
                    <p>
                        We successfully delivered a application that streamlined workflow management processes for
                        ocularists and admins.
                        The application resolves all major frictions in current system and fulfills most requirements
                        from Moorfields:<br>
                        ☑ Organised data representation using fiters,expanding windows and search functionalites<br>
                        ☑ Non-repetitive appointmemt management process<br>
                        ☑ Synchronisation between users to prevent overwriting<br>
                        We are very pround of accomplishing 89% of the key functionalities in the MOSCOW list.<br>
                        For the requirements that we didn't fulfill,
                        requirement 17 ,19 and 20 involves automatically arranging appointments and suggesting patients.
                        Implementation of these functionalites has high complexity that invloves machine learning.
                        Due to the time constraints we decided to narrow down the scope and focus on fulfilling other
                        major requirements.<br>
                        During one of the meetings,Moorfields confirmed us that ocularists and admins prefer manually
                        book in appointmemts
                        so we decide not to implement requirement 17,19 and 20 upon agreements with Moorfields eye
                        Hospital.<br>
                        This reflexs our ability to critical thinking,project management and client liaison.<br>
                        The application is very extensible providing its well documented and structured database
                        following best practice.
                        We also tested every functionality to ensure they work perfectly.<br>
                        Overall we have good functionality!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Stability-Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted multiple testing procedures to ensure our application is stable.
                        We managed to reach code coverage of 97%.<br>
                        Passing all unit tests, we know all individual functions work as we intended.
                        Passing all intergrated tests, we know individual fucntions are intergrated correctly and
                        perform as we expected.<br>
                        Our application respond to request with few second.
                        It processes filters within few seconds.
                        If this application is to be further developed, we can switch SQLite to a database suits for
                        large volume such as azure cosmos database and switch docker to virtual machine
                        We can say that we have very good stability and efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Compatibility and Maintainability</h3>
                    <p>
                        We deployed our application by running it as a docker image and host it on Azure cloud.
                        This allows our application to be accessed by multiple browsers.
                        We application also runs perfectly on mobile phone and ipad.<br>
                        If multiple systems were to be integrated such as synchronising our workflow management app with
                        PAS,
                        a virtue machine should be a better option than docker.

                        Our codebase has clear model-view-template structure.
                        All modules and classes are given sensible names so that our code is highly cohesive.<br>
                        Each functionality has seperated view class and html templates, ensuring our code is loosely
                        coupled.
                        We also thoroughly documented our codebase and tested each modules to make sure thet work.
                        Overall our application has good compatibility and is easy to maintain <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="text-gradient">Project management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team used gantt chart timeline to make sure our project is on track
                        and use trello board to organised our work and to set up tasks for teammates.<br>
                        This is shared between our project monitor and Moorfields eye Hospital.<br>
                        We also take minutes of every meetings we had with Moorfields eye Hospital.
                        This way we can go back and check what we discussed and agreed with them.<br>
                        After we started implementing the application,
                        we wrote a google doc with a list of checkboxs regarding specific coding tasks that we need to
                        do.<br>
                        We use telegram to communicate with team mates on daily bases and we have regular weekly
                        meetings with our TA,
                        project monitor and our client Moorfields Eye Hospital.<br>

                        Overall We had good project management skill.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="section-title text-gradient header-underline">Further work</h1>
                    <p>If more time are given, we will make following improvements<br>
                        1. Make log in box presents at the middle of the page, with 'fogot password' functionality<br>
                        2. Provide instruction on how to select multiple team members at team rota.<br>
                        3. Improve page layout for mobiles and ipads<br>
                        4. Prompts that require users to confirm their actions.
                        5. Functionality for Manufacturing Tracking<br>
                        6. Automated patient suggestion according to their appointmemt type and wait time.<br>
                        7. Intergrated with PAS and OpenEye systems.
