                    <p>In order to perform a critical evaluation on ourselves we will evaluate our performance in different

                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">User Interface and Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        We followed HCI design principles of visibility, consistency and feedback while implementing our
                        user
                        interfaces.<br> There are various examples of where we applied these principles across our
                        system, these examples can be found by clicking the 'UI Design' tab on the navigation
                        bar.<br><br>

                        Also, we always made attempts to evaluate the project from a user's perspective, this was done
                        in 2 ways.<br><br>

                        ☑ We demonstrated our progress with the project in our weekly meetings with Moorfields. As our
                        client was going to be the main user of the system, their feedback was from a user's
                        perspective. We considered their feedback to help build a system that provided the best user
                        experience.
                        We balanced their feedback with the time constraints to avoid scope creep.<br><br>

                        ☑ We conducted a user acceptance test's on users who have not used the system before. We used
                        users
                        who have different levels of software proficiency to perform tasks on our system.
                        The result shows that all testers found our application easy to use.
                        A senior ocularist at Moorfields said they were particularly impressed by the design of the
                        rota page. Testers pointed out that found difficulty in selecting and viewing multiple
                        ocularists'
                        rotas on the team rota page. To remedy this, we created a user manual that gives new users
                        instructions on how to use our system. Further feedback from our user acceptance tests can be
                        found on the 'Testing' tab on
                        the navigation bar.<br><br>

                        Overall, from the feedback from our client (who is also the user), and our user acceptance
                        testers, our application provides a simple, easy to use and usable user interface. We believe
                        that this was
                        achieved by stringently following the HCI design principles.<br><br>
                        We rate our achievement in 'User Interface and Experience' as <span

                        We successfully delivered workflow management proof-of-concept.
                        The application resolves all of the major frictions in Moorfields' current system which we
                        identified at the start of the project.<br><br>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We are very proud of accomplishing <span class="excellent"><strong>87.5%</strong></span> of the
                        key functionality in the
                        functional MOSCOW list.
                        It is also important to note that our client is very satisfied with the proof-of-concept that we
                        handed over to them.<br><br>

                        For the requirements that we didn't fulfil, specifically requirements 17 and 18 these
                        requirements involve automatically
                        arranging appointments and suggesting patients.
                        We believe that the best way to implement this functionality involves machine learning and is
                        quite complex.
                        The complexity of this is important because, due to the time constraints, we decided that
                        implementing this complex functionality was not feasible. Therefore, we mutually agreed with
                        Moorfields
                        that this functionality would not be included in the proof-of-concept that we would hand over to
                        them. Moorfields confirmed that ocularists and admins prefer to manually
                        book in appointments so we decided to narrow down the scope and focus on fulfilling other
                        major requirements.<br><br>

                        Overall we produced a proof-of-concept that Moorfields is very satisfied with and solves
                        Moorfields' major frictions with the current system and achieves <span
                            class="excellent"><strong>87.5%</strong></span> of the functionality
                        outlined in our functional MoSCoW list.<br><br>


                        We rate our achievement in 'Functionality' as <span
                            class="excellent"><strong>Excellent</strong></span>.

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Stability</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted two different types of automated testing to ensure our application is stable, we
                        used unit tests and integration tests.
                        We managed to reach a code coverage of <span class="excellent"><strong>97%</strong></span>.
                        Passing all unit tests informs us that individual functions work as we intended. Passing all
                        integration tests informs us that views integrate with templates to render or redirect to the
                        correct
                        template.<br><br>

                        One way that we could improve our testing procedure to more rigorously measure the stability is to
                        check what values are passed to each template in the response. Currently, this check is not
                        performed on
                        every integration test. Implementing this check would only require adding one extra assert
                        statement to the test so there is not much extra work for future developers.<br><br>

                        Overall we have a high test coverage with all tests passing. Some tests could be extended to be
                        more rigorous.<br><br>

                        We rate our achievement in 'Stability' as <span class="very-good"><strong>Very
                                Good</strong></span>.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since our codebase is very simple, it’s very efficient to run.
                        Currently, our application responds to a request within a few seconds.
                        It processes searches and logins within a few seconds too.<br><br>

                        This proof-of-concept will not be used with real patients data, it will be used to aid
                        development for Moorfields. Because of this, it was a low priority for us to measure efficiency,
                        particularly with a large database of patients as this was unlikely to happen under Moorfields
                        normal usage of the system.<br><br>

                        Currently, using a small database of patients we rate our achievement in 'Efficiency' as <span
                            class="excellent"><strong>Excellent</strong></span>.<br><br>
                        *To further measure efficiency, beyond what we measured, future developers should test on larger
                        datasets.

                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Compatibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        We deployed our application by running it as a docker image and hosting it on Azure Cloud.
                        This allows our application to be accessed by multiple browsers, across multiple devices from
                        anywhere with an internet connection.<br><br>

                        In addition to this, we programmed the front-end in Bootstrap, this improves the compatibility
                        because Bootstrap supports automatic formatting for different devices.
                        To elaborate, the page and the navbar will automatically change based on screen size in order to
                        display all of the contents in a clear and logical fashion.<br><br>

                        If multiple systems were to be integrated such as synchronising our workflow management app with
                        PAS,
                        a virtual machine could be a better option than docker as docker is better suited to supporting
                        one application.
                        If this is the case, Moorfields can implement this as the source code for the project has been
                        provided via a git repository.<br><br>

                        Overall our system has compatibility across multiple devices. It has good potential for
                        compatibility with other systems that Moorfields use. If Moorfields would like to implement this
                        compatibility across systems we have suggested how they could do so.<br><br>

                        We rate our achievement in 'Compatability' as <span
                            class="excellent"><strong>Excellent</strong></span>.
                    </p>
                    <br>


                    <h3 class="section-title text-gradient">Maintainability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our code comes with documentation in for form of a website. Other developers should not have any
                        trouble understanding what the code does and how it does it. Meaning it would be easy for them
                        to modify the code to implement new features<br><br>

                        Our code also comes with an easy to use, CI pipeline. Developers only need to push to main for
                        changes to be reflected on the live server, more information about the CI pipeline can be seen
                        on the 'Deployment' tab on the navigation bar.<br><br>

                        For the most part, our code complies with PEP8 standards. We performed checks on our code with
                        flake8
                        and fixed the syntax standard violations. We did this to make our code as readable as possible
                        for future developers, we believe that the more readable the code is, the more maintainable it
                        can be.<br><br>

                        We also have a small codebase with sensible variable names which further makes the code readable
                        and easy to follow.<br><br>

                        We implemented separation of concerns this can further help with maintainability, we did this
                        when we separated the views into different files and and when we followed the MVT design pattern.<br><br>

                        Overall we took multiple actions to make our codebase as maintainable as possible in order to
                        aid development during the project and future development by Moorfields. <br><br>

                        We rate our achievement in 'Maintainability' as <span
                            class="excellent"><strong>Excellent</strong></span>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-gradient">Project Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team used a Gantt chart timeline to make sure our project is on track
                        and we used Trello board to organise our work and to set tasks for teammates during the design
                        phase.
                        We shared these with our TA, our IXN mentor and Moorfields.<br><br>

                        We met our client weekly on Thursday afternoons to discuss progress. During each of these
                        meetings, we took minutes so we could refer back to them during the week. We also had weekly
                        meetings with our TA and our IXN mentor.<br><br>

                        During the implementation phase, it was easier for us to allocate tasks on a Google doc than on
                        Trello. The Google doc had a list with checkboxes of tasks that needed to be completed. The tasks
                        were colour coded based on priority and who was assigned to it. A majority of the team completed
                        tasks
                        by the agreed deadlines.<br><br>

                        We used telegram to communicate with teammates and email to communicate with
                        Moorfields.<br><br>

                        Overall, we rate our achievement in 'Project Management' as <span class="very-good"><strong>Very
                                Good</strong></span>.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="section-title text-gradient header-underline">Further Work</h1>
                    <p> If more time was given, we would make implement the following features to further improve our
                        system:<br><br>
                        1. We would integrate our system with PAS. Doing so would save time on things like adding
                        patients to the workflow application. We could also add functionality to automatically create
                        and
                        send letters to patients once appointments have been made, this would save time for the admin
                        staff.<br><br>

                        2. Automatic appointment allocation. This was one of the suggestions made when exploring the
                        requirements at the start of the project.
                        We thought it was too complex to fully implement in our timeframe. Future developers could use
                        information about previous appointments
                        to predict when the best time is to book a new appointment and automatically book this
                        appointment.<br><br>

                        3. Further support for mobile device users. Moorfields primarily use computers to manage
                        patients so we spent all of our time
                        designing our UI for a computer user, however, using Bootstrap meant that all of the content is
                        still visible on mobile devices.
                        In the future, we believe we could provide a more usable UI for mobile devices if we spent more
                        designing specifically for these devices.<br><br>

                        4. Improve the login experience. Currently, our login page is very bare-bones. If we had extra
                        time, we would consult users on how to improve the experience.
                        We believe that implementing 'Forgot Password' functionality may be one way to improve the user
                        experience when logging in.<br><br>

                        5. Prompts that require users to confirm their actions. Currently, a user can delete an
                        appointment at the click of a button. Although the purpose of the
                        button is very clear, it may be a good idea to ask users to confirm their actions to avoid
                        mistakes from occurring when using the system. If it takes a significant
                        amount of extra admin work to rebook the appointment, this functionality could be incredibly
                        useful.<br><br>

                        6. Functionality for manufacturing tracking. We explored this functionality at the start of the
                        project however we decided to
                        narrow the scope and not implement this in our system. Once our system is polished it could
                        be useful for Moorfields to track which
                        materials were used for which prosthetic.<br><br>

                        7. Given more time, we would love to further refactor our codebase
                        to make things even more modular. A lot of our functionality refreshes the webpage
                        the user was currently on, which means that we duplicate sections of code in a lot of places.
                        For example, at many points we have to fetch the list of appointments, and we in fact have 
                        a known bug where sometimes the list of appointments is not tagged properly! This can be all
                        solved by introducing a base method that returns the information needed to populate the template, 
                        and then overriding some of the other functionality, to differentiate the operations.<br><br>

                        8. Currently, we have tested the system for simultaneous use; and it works! The backend model on the 
                        server will track changes in real time and prevent overwriting of data. However the visuals on screen
                        are not always seen in real time, you have to infact refresh to see the changes to the rota or appointment 
                        list. Given the time and resources, we would like to implement a solution that uses <samp>AJAX</samp> in 
                        order to automatically refresh the template whenever the backend Model changes.<br><br>

                        9. We have set user groups and permissions seperately for admin staff and ocularist staff, and 
                        given then time it would be natural to retrict their permissions when using the app. This way
                        the PAS checklist can only be confirmed by a member of the admin users group. Features like This
                        would make the system more reflective of who has what work to do, and decreases the chance for someone 
                        to make a mistake.<br><br>

                        10. Everytime that we Dockerise and deploy the application to Azure, the local database is 
                        used to create the Docker image. As such, all remote data, <i>i.e. on Azure</i> is lost and 
                        overwritten by the local copy of the database. Though this is fine for a proof of concept, 
                        we should have the backend database mounted as a persistent file storage to our container 
                        registry or container instance. There already exist solutions to this, and it would be natural during
                        real world use to want to maintain the information located in the database.
